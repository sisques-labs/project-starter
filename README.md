# SaaS Boilerplate

A complete and scalable boilerplate for building modern SaaS applications. This project uses a Turborepo monorepo and is designed with DDD (Domain-Driven Design), CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), and Event-Driven Architecture.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

This is a monorepo built with **Turborepo** that includes multiple applications and shared packages, all written in **TypeScript**.

## 🚀 Applications and Packages

### 🔌 API (`apps/api`)

Backend API built with **NestJS** implementing DDD, CQRS, and Event-Driven Architecture. Features GraphQL API with Apollo Server, PostgreSQL (via Prisma) for transactional data, and MongoDB for Event Store.

Includes bounded contexts: Auth, User, Tenant, Billing, Event Store, and Health.

### 🌐 Web App (`apps/web`)

Next.js 16 web application for end users with React 19 and Tailwind CSS 4.

### 🛠️ Admin Panel (`apps/admin`)

Next.js 16 administration panel with integrated SDK for API communication.

### 📱 Mobile App (`apps/mobile`)

Cross-platform React Native application with Expo, supporting iOS, Android, and Web.

### 📚 Docs (`apps/docs`)

Documentation site built with Astro and Starlight.

### 📦 SDK (`packages/sdk`)

Shared TypeScript SDK for interacting with the API from any client. Includes GraphQL client, React hooks, and automatic token management. Compatible with web and React Native.

See `packages/sdk/README.md` for complete usage examples.

## 🔄 Using the Boilerplate as a Living Base for Projects

This repository is designed to function as a **living boilerplate**, not as a one-time use template. A project can be created from this repository (for example, using "Use this template" or cloning it and uploading it to a new repo) without preserving the complete Git history of the boilerplate. However, it's still possible to continue receiving future improvements (auth, i18n, layout, global configuration, tooling, etc.) by adding this repository as an additional remote (`boilerplate`).

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Add the boilerplate as a remote:**

   ```bash
   git remote add boilerplate <url-of-this-repo>
   git fetch boilerplate
   ```

2. **First merge (initial integration):**

   ```bash
   git merge boilerplate/main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```

   This flag is necessary because both repositories don't share history. After this initial merge, subsequent merges work in a standard way.

3. **Future updates:**
   ```bash
   git fetch boilerplate
   git merge boilerplate/main
   ```

### Best Practices

To avoid conflicts, derived projects should:

- ✅ **Develop only new functionality** within domain folders or `features/`
- ✅ **Keep core and cross-cutting layers** (auth, i18n, layout, configuration, and shared packages) as **exclusive property of the boilerplate**
- ❌ **Avoid copying and pasting code manually** - all updates should be done via Git to maintain structural coherence and traceability

## 🏛️ API Architecture

### DDD (Domain-Driven Design)

The API is organized into **Bounded Contexts**, each representing a specific business domain:

- Each context is independent and has its own domain model
- Contexts communicate through domain events
- Clear separation between domain, application, and infrastructure

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

- **Commands**: Operations that modify state (write)
- **Queries**: Operations that only read data (read)
- Separation of read and write models
- Independent optimization of each side

### Event-Driven Architecture

- **Event Store**: All domain events are stored in MongoDB
- **Event Sourcing**: State reconstruction from events
- **Event Handlers**: Asynchronous event processing
- **Event Replay**: Ability to replay historical events

### Operation Flow

1. **Transport Layer** (GraphQL Resolver) receives the request
2. **Application Layer** (Command/Query Handler) processes the logic
3. **Domain Layer** (Aggregate) executes business rules
4. **Infrastructure Layer** (Repository) persists changes
5. **Event Bus** publishes domain events
6. **Event Handlers** process events (update read models, send notifications, etc.)

## 🔐 Authentication and Authorization

JWT-based authentication with multi-provider support (Local, Google, Apple). Role-based access control at user and tenant levels.

## 💳 Billing and Subscriptions

Subscription management with configurable plans, multi-currency support, and Stripe integration ready. Supports trial periods and automatic/manual renewal.

## 📊 Event Store

Complete event sourcing implementation with audit trail, event replay capabilities, and full traceability of all operations.
